# WeatherAppV1

# This is Weather Application that shows weather with the city code using OpenWeather RestfulAPI. I have used reactJs. If you are planning to use this application, you need API key from OpenWeather API and then you need to create a creds.js in (src/containers/weatherList/) and inside that file have the variable 'weatherApiKey'.
